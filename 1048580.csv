					I've been playing this on and off since it was in beta, and went to give it another go with all the latest update before it comes to an end to see what its like now

however after i get past the tutorial, i cant seem to get into the proper mountains, just getting a grey screen instead still with menu music, then back to the menu room, but with no menus.

I tried restarting, reloading, different gfx settings etc. It even said the demo was a virus at one point, so made an exception for it. After over 30 mins...				"

								This is exactly how cool boarders 1 felt when I played a PS1 for the first time as a 13 year old. But then in VR! Tighten your gloves because it will be rough in 'Terje Haakonsen's Powder VR'. Winter games in VR is an experience that we VR players have been looking forward to for a long time, with the quality that Powder VR has to offer us, you will undoubtedly spend a high number of hours on this. Even when you have unlocked all locations and items, these Powder VR experiences are undoubtedly open to multiple replays! Glide down very high mountain peaks in a flash on skis or a snowboard, or fly like a squirrel just above the white plains with a wingsuit. You will have to unlock the wingsuit or a boosterpack through mini games that are accessible through the exploration mode, after that you will be able to use them in other activities besides the mini games and you can use the wingsuit from any jump, if it is high enough. By default you will have to do different modes in the world tour such as racing, checkpoints or freestyle, but via the minigames you can do even more challenging activities that belong to those modes, but just a little too challenging for a world tour to keep sporty. These modes will offer even more in the future once multiplayer support becomes available. Through the mini games you can gain a bit more extreme experiences, despite the fact that the world tour activities can already have high challenges. I like freestyle in exploration mode, so you can seek and conquer the highest jumps and the thinnest edges, or just enjoy the peaceful winter environments. You can also do tricks in the game with both skis and snowboard, here you will have to do flips or turns using movements with the controllers and you will also have to do a nose or tail grab manually. The locations in the game are also inspired by real mountain locations, for example Mt Albus in the game is based on the Mt Blanc of the Alps, or Kastle Ridge which is inspired by the slovak tatras national park which has a castle on a hill top, with snow peaks of course. Terje Haakonsen's Powder VR is like no other currently on the market and highly recommended! Skis & snowboard montage video:  			"

								Long awaited game especially due to high expectations on how developers will handle controls and I must say I am pretty impressed. I am mainly snowboarder so I will not provide much detail on how skiing is in this game. Anyway overally in early access this game seems legit. Peos: - controls general concept feel natural - there is almost no sickness or nausea but I may had already built up some threshold in other vr titles - after initiating air time on board game goes into slowmo which is really great to think the tricks at the moment - tracking pretty much guess the position of body and knees right - there is really nice music not any smash and boom type you would expect from this type of game - the game physics leans more toward simulation then arcade - people can eventually learn snowboarding in this game without prior experience - the overal atmosphere in game and visuals are very indie but feel great Cons: - turning with hands positioning feels little off as in real snowboarding it is mostly done by hips and legs - jumping controls are merged with nudging which makes it little hard to get jumps right initially - there is definitelly a learning curve - the is no physics matching leaning towards the front and back foot which feels unnatural - graphics is simplistic - the dude in explore mode looks weird :) - character avatars are little too sci-fi - the shop and gearing up is unfinished but i am looking forward full release I really enjoy the game even aware of cons and may find more when longer in game. I do not think there is any other title covering winter sports like this out there for all vr platforms so thumbs up from me.			"

					My beta key for Powder was revoked today (expired I suppose) so it has disappeared from my Steam library and so I have no option to uninstall the game, which is still present on my HD and I assume in my registry.

					I'm not a skier, just thought it looked like fun.

During the tutorial I found the physics kind of weird, like my skis were not sliding freely on the snow, I couldn't get going... then suddenly I'd be zooming along, then get stuck again.  Speed control seemed to be all over the place and steering didn't seem to work as in the instructions;  I would be sideslipping to the right all the time, even when turning my hands to steer to the left.

But I struggled along and eventually it got ""slippery"" ... and then...				"

					My only complaint would be the constant cloud of snow spray in your face. Kinda ruins the fun if you can't see. An option to eliminate the snow cloud and frost on your goggles or even the goggles entirely. The graphics so far aren't stunning or anything, but better than any other vr ski game I've tried. I'll definitely buy it....				"

								I only played briefly but I was surprised by how good the snowboarding felt. I have yet to try the skiing. I have experienced some crashes, but I'm mostly left impressed by how the snowboarding felt. At the end of a run I swung the board horizontally to stop and the game tracked the motion more nicely than I would have expected. Considering this game is pretty much the first VR game of it's kind, I'd say it's worth a shot. Sure costs less than a lift ticket, and from my experience with the snowboarding is enough like the real thing to be thrilling I absolutely suck at the game btw, I'm gonna have to figure out the mechanics more because I got demolished in my first race. Perhaps a suggestion I'd have is some sort of ""Unlock All"" cheat code or mode where we can access all the levels without having to beat the game, as right now I could see a lot of players getting frustrated unlocking all of the content			"

								Have been waiting for a long time for a VR game to give me that feeling of being an extreme sport athlete. This game has easily filled that gap for me. Being able to flip/spin while flinging yourself off cliffs feels amazing (all with comfort options so providing you have your VR legs you can unlock the camera) but even being able to bomb through chutes without the fear of injuring yourself is worth the price alone. Have spent the majority of time on skis and there has definitely been some thought getting the controls right to give you feeling of being on the snow. If you're exploring, I'd suggest chucking the controllers through a belt positioned at your hips or in your pockets. Being able to drive into turns with your knees feels insanely realistic and a lot of fun for bombing hills. Devs have managed to capture that easy to pick up, hard to master mechanic so if you are struggling, keep practicing and it will click. Mountains are enormous with plenty of variety. With more coming, there are many hours of finding new lines.			"

								A bold attempt at VR simulation of snowboarding / skiing. As someone who rides weekly in resort (and just got back from snowbird and solitude this weekend), and tours regularly once the snowpack has set in, the physics of this game unfortunately do not add up. The acceleration in deep powder (or even packed snow) should not be this quick. During carves deceleration and further acceleration from heel/toe should not just be ""forward momentum changes"". The powder/snow effects are outdated. The mountains are fairly barren. I feel that the graphics engine is not optimized at this time for the eye-candy / performance ratio (i'm on a RTX 3070 and oculus rift).  Unfortunately the graphics are far from AA/AAA gaming at this time.  I do feel that this has the potential to become ""Steep"" VR, and hope that it gets there some day. At this time it is hard to recommend as a purchase. Will re-post review once more updates (hopefully) come.			"

My ski sticks will randomly disappear at some point (and sometimes come back randomly).

When it gets to the first time where you actually start skiing downhill, you have 10 seconds to make it through the goal post...

								The first approach with this game was strange, because the overall behavior was very different from what I expected to be. Years ago I played quite a bit the arcadey but overall fun Fancy Skiing VR: despite being unrealistic you were able to ski and especially turn in seconds, very intuitive. Powder VR is just the opposite, it uses a mix of head orientation, head position from the center and hands position than can be seriously confusing, especially with the snowboard. After the first hour, I started to understand how to play it and how to configure things into options for my needs. Still, I hope the control system will be improved in future, pointing more on leaning and less to hands position and head rotation, and in general with more care for intuitivity. Comfort is good, better than my expectations. There are quite a lot of contents and unlockables just now and more to come, polishing and UI need some work but being an Early Access this is expected. It's the better skiing experience for VR, as far as I know, mostly because there are not many serious opponents and this is sad, skiing fits VR so well. But it's clear than devs have passion, just see how many patches they released and their roadmap, this game will improve. So it deserves to be supported, my review is positive. You should consider it if you're interested in trying to ski in VR, but if you're looking from a full and polished experience, could be better to wait for the full release.			"

					Although many of my friends and family seem to have VR comfort issues for even some fairly tame games (considered ""comfortable""), it seems I'm quite the opposite, with a strong tolerance (and desire) for break-every-VR-comfort-guideline-imaginable experiences, including my own VR game prototype in which I temporarily shift the camera perspective to an object (e.g. golf ball) that's been sent soaring through the air, a.k.a.

								It shows little playtime, but i was a tester from a long time. Ive never been snow boarding, but this game feels ""natural"" like... considering the limitations i think they did a great job taking the sense of speed, my height, and knee movement, and all that into the game.  I definetively think the experience would improve with trackers so i could track my feet and hips. But even without them i had a really good time. But i think the game is a little confusing?, as in where i need to go, maybe its meant for me to explore, but i think as someone that has never been to a snow resort, it felt confusing navigating it, which i guess talks about the size of it. Very rarely do i want to be taken by the hand way more, and this is one of those times. Jumping and grinding sometimes feel like i mistimed them when i think i didnt,  Basic tutorial is fine, if after that finished that i was a bit lost. Graphics are ok as is performance, neither is superb, but with a gtx1080 it was very acceptable. Recommended if you are even a little interested in skying, its not the real thing of course, but its probably the best vr simulation of it right now.			"

								Unfortunately I can't recommend this game even though I would wish. The game is simply boring and . Too much space and there is lack of that ""VR feeling"" when you play this game. The calibration is really messed up. Tutorial is annoying and not too helpful. Its better to actually skip it and try to learn controls during a normal quick race. There is also a lot of let's call it, blank space, so you are just riding skiis and just do nothing.. no slalom, no andrenaline, no feeling. I wish the game had slalom mode with flags. For that price I believe it should have it. Somebody in a different review already mentioned poor physics and how the game feels different than skiing in real life. Others would say: ""Hey, but this is just a game"". Well, I would reply to this, there is a free to play game offering skiing that has a much better feeling comparing to real life skiing than this game does. it's just not an entertaining game. There is no joy.			"

I cant really recommend this game in its current state as the games limits are really tested if you try to simply do a 360 or something, or start going too fast it really falls apart. Plus im not a fan of the anchored floor point system It keeps putting the center in the room in front of my wall, which i can fix but i dont think i should have to.  Also, drop the medal count thing for free roam,  just let people slide around for wherever they want thats such a dated thing for extreme sports games to require and really kills it for me, im not gonna grind out races in a game that doesnt really work well at high speeds/ doing jumps.
